# Transmit

## Introduction

### The Project 
The project aims to design and develop a TSN (Tailored Social Network) platform that offers advanced functionalities beyond traditional platforms like Facebook. The platform must be based on a graph structure, inspired by the FOAF (Friend of a Friend) Ontology, enabling users to connect, interact, and share content in a more personalized and intuitive manner.

### See it live
We recently enabled GA (General Availability) of our project, making it accessible online, by everyone.
You can see it here : https://transmit-project.vercel.app/about

### Local Installation
Run `pnpm install` to get started and install all dependencies.
If you don't have `pnpm` installed, simply run `npm install -g pnpm`.

Run `pnpm dev` for a dev server ; then, navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. You don't need to run anything else in order to get started ; our project completely relies on on-device-computing making it  backendless, and the database is hosted online.
